A sophisticated Monte Carlo simulation for football betting hedging strategies that automatically adapts to market conditions.

## 🎯 Overview

This system implements an intelligent hedging approach that dynamically switches between two strategies based on coefficient values:
- **High Coefficient Strategy** (≥4.0) - For matches with clear favorites/underdogs
- **Balanced Market Strategy** (<4.0) - For evenly matched games

## 📊 Features

- **🔄 Adaptive Strategy Selection** - Automatically chooses optimal approach
- **🎲 Monte Carlo Simulation** - 10,000+ iterations for robust testing
- **📈 Professional Risk Management** - 2% discount on hedge coefficients
- **📊 Comprehensive Analytics** - Detailed performance metrics
- **💡 Intelligent Recommendations** - Risk assessment and strategy insights

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6+
- No external dependencies

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/adaptive-hedging-system.git
cd adaptive-hedging-system

Usage
bash

python hedging_simulation.py

Input Format
text

Enter coefficients (1 X 2): 2.8 3.0 2.7
Enter bets (1 X 2): 3000 3000 4000
Enter number of iterations (default 10000): 50000

🧮 Mathematical Foundation
Core Algorithm
python

# Strategy Selection
if max_coef >= 4:
    strategy = "HIGH_COEFFICIENT"
    base_cash = max(payouts)
else:
    strategy = "BALANCED_MARKET" 
    base_cash = min(payouts)

# Hedge Calculations
hedge_amount = deficit / (coefficient * 0.98)
result = final_cash + hedge_income - payout

Key Formulas

    Hedge Coefficients: original_coef × 0.98

    Base Cash: Strategy-dependent selection

    Deficit Coverage: Precise mathematical hedging

    Profit Calculation: Comprehensive P&L analysis
